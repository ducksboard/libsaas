This is libsaas, a library to take the pain out of using SaaS APIs.

It provides an abstraction layer on top of various APIs, taking care of
constructing the URLs, serializing parameters and authentication. You just call
Python methods and receive Python objects.

It's like an ORM for SaaS!

Libsaas is built by Ducksboard_ and distributed under the MIT license. You can
file bugs in the `issue tracker`_, browse the documentation_ or help out by
constributing support for new services.
